# ATAC-seq
Basic workflow for ATAC-seq analysis

This is a work-in-progress compilation of various commands and tools intended for an ATAC-seq analysis workflow, largely based on the pipeline developed by Anshul Kundaje's group (Stanford) and the ENCODE project.

Attempt to run each command individually or in blocks after editing to match your own data architecture.
