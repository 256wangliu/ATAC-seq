# ATAC-seq

These scripts correspond to a (differential) ATAC-seq analysis workflow as described [in our recent report](https://epigeneticsandchromatin.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13072-020-00342-y). It is largely based on the pipeline developed by [Anshul Kundaje's group (Stanford) and the ENCODE project](https://www.encodeproject.org/pipelines/ENCPL792NWO/).

If you use this methodology, please cite the following paper along with corresponding pipeline dependencies:

Jake J. Reske, Mike R. Wilson, and Ronald L. Chandler. 2020. ATAC-seq normalization method can significantly affect differential accessibility analysis and interpretation. Epigenetics & Chromatin 13: 22.

Attempt to run each command individually or in blocks after editing to match your own data architecture.
