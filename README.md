# ATAC-seq
Basic workflow for ATAC-seq analysis.

This is a work-in-progress compilation of various commands and tools intended for an ATAC-seq analysis workflow, largely based on the pipeline developed by [Anshul Kundaje's group (Stanford) and the ENCODE project](https://www.encodeproject.org/pipelines/ENCPL792NWO/).

Attempt to run each command individually or in blocks after editing to match your own data architecture.
